## Simple Model Builder

This web app lets you select different feastures to build a linear regression model that will attempt to predict the temperature. Please find the requirements in "requirements.txt". To run the app, clone the repo, navigate to the repo and run:

'''python app.py'''

### Bugs
In the current version, you have to select the "Temperature (C)" in the home page in order to get a result returned. 
Note that if you select columns such as "Summary", you will get an error as it is no a float or integer data type.
